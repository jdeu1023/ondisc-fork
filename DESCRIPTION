Description: Single-cell datasets are growing in size, posing challenges as well as opportunities for biology researchers. 'ondisc' (short for "on-disk single cell") enables users to easily and efficiently analyze large-scale single-cell data. 'ondisc' aims to make computing on large-scale single-cell data FUN: Fast, Universal, and iNtuitive.
